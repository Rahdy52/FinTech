# OPEN BANKING: BASIQ
This research is about open banking, featuring one of the pioneering companies called Basiq. There will be no in-depth discussion on this one because this is only used for school assignment and the main purpose is to just be able to learn stuff such as Github, Dillinger.io, and Markdown, and of course, to pass the course. So don't expect anything useful, rather, pray that I pass this one.
## Overview and Origin
**Open Banking**
It is an innovation in financial services sector anchored on federal legislation known as the Consumer Data Right (CDR) in Australia. (CDR is an initiative to drive competition and development of new financial products and services by laying out set of rules for the consumers to share their data with accredited third parties for the latter to provide them products and services accordingly.)

The foreseen benefits are:
For Businesses
1. Zero overhead from manual integration with a number of financial institutions;
2. Levels the playing field in creating new products and services;
For Consumers
1. Simplification of switching banks and sharing information;
2. Use case for signing up for new credit or debit card, manage joint accounts, apply for investment loans, and utilise financial products and budgeting tools.
3. More enjoyable interactive experience;
For Fintechs, Banks and Other Organisations
1. Allows smaller companies and financial institutions equal access to market;
2. easier to initiate consumer data sharing between data holders and data recipients;
